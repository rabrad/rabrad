### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I recently became fascinated by web programming e.g. developing apps
and building websites, thanks to the [`Hack Your Future`](https://www.hackyourfuture.net/) coding school and
its community of enthusiast developers.
As this area complements my studies and profession as a [`graphic designer`](https://www.behance.net/rabee),
I am keen to gain more experience in the field.

### Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio ðŸŒ±
